# Preferences
An attempt to streamline setting up new physical or virtual machines.

You know the pain of getting a new computer or setting up a new virtual machine? 
Well, most people don't really get new computers all that often. I don't either. 
But I do sometimes, and there are a few tools that I really enjoy having.

This is my first attempt or putting up a pack of preferences together. Eventually, my goal is 
to also write a bash (and a fish, since that one is more to my liking) script, to
install important and necessary packages, and move the preference files around.
